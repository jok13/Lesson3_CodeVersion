            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> HTTP is a set of rules you have to follow in order to exchange things on the internet such as text, graphics, sound, video, and other multimedia files. HTTP is completely connection-free, media independent, and state-less. First an HTTP client initiates a request to the server. An HTTP client can be things such as web browser, robot, or a search engine. Once the request is initiated the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response. It is important to note any type can be sent by HTTP as long as the client and server know how to handle the data content. Requests are sent in the form of a request method, URL, and protocol version followed by an MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)-like messages. The server then responds with a status line, including the messages protocol version and success or error code followed by a MIME-like message. I find it interesting that the server and the client are only aware of each other during current request and afterwards they both forget each other existed. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Hypertext Markup Language</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">HTML is essentially a coding language used to create web pages and documents for the World Wide Web. HTML utilizes a special set of instructions called tags or markup to define the structure and layout of the web pages. HTML is platform dependent meaning even if you create your HTML document on your computer, somebody else; hundreds of miles away could see it on their web browser. The way the language is setup, whenever you want to insert a feature you enter the opening tag for it followed by the content and then a closing tag. For example if you want to have a header with your name, you would type; the header tag, your name then followed by the header tag again. There are hundreds of tags that help you make your web page unique and your own such as the paragraph tag or the image tag. There are also a lot ways to create your HTML code. In order from least flexible to most flexible, you could use a text editor, a HTML text editor, a HTML object text editor, or even a WYSIWY editor which gives you the most features.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are five phases in the development life cycle. The first phase is the planning phase in which you have to figure out what the purpose of the website is, who is going to use it, what are the users computing environment, and whose info is going to be on the website. Next is the analysis phase in which you need to figure out what task needs to be performed, and what info would be useful, as well as the process considerations.  Then there is the design and development phase, which in my opinion is the most important phase. In this phase you need to figure out things such as how many web pages will there be and what do they look like. Ask yourself, what website structure would be most appropriate and user friendly? You need to figure out what file naming convention and folder structure would be most beneficial. Are there going to make use of any multimedia? You also have to plan for people with accessibility issues as well as international issues. Coming to a close you have to go through a testing phase. Does the website pass the World Wide Web consortium validation process? The website has to function and have correct info. Ask yourself are users able to find the info they need? Finally, the last step is the implementation and maintenance phase which is essentially making sure the website is published and updated. </p>
